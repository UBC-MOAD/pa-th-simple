The IPython Notebooks in this directory are related to the
development of the preliminary Pa-Th off-line model for working with
results from the CCAR models of the Arctic and associated basins.

    Coupled 2D Model currently solves the [Th] and [Pa] on a 2D grid using an upwind advection scheme. It contains plots of [Th] profile for a simple rotational velocity field, and for a more complex rotational and downwelling velocity field, as well as plots of the ratio of [Th]/[Pa] on the 2D grid.
