The IPython Notebooks in this directory are related to the
development of the preliminary Pa-Th off-line model for working with
results from the CCAR models of the Arctic and associated basins.

The links below are to static renderings of the notebooks via
[nbviewer.ipython.org](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/).
Descriptions below the links are from the first cell of the notebooks
(if that cell contains Markdown or raw text).
