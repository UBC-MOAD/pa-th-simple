The IPython Notebooks in this directory are related to the
development of the preliminary Pa-Th off-line model for working with
results from the CCAR models of the Arctic and associated basins.

The links below are to static renderings of the notebooks via
[nbviewer.ipython.org](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/).
Descriptions below the links are from the first cell of the notebooks
(if that cell contains Markdown or raw text).

* ##[1D Particulate Sinking.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/ccar-modeling/pa-th/raw/tip/prelim-model/1D Particulate Sinking.ipynb)  
    
* ##[ThPa ratio.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/ccar-modeling/pa-th/raw/tip/prelim-model/ThPa ratio.ipynb)  
    
    Plots [Th]/[Pa] for three different velocity fields: stationary, single cell, and two cell overturning.  

* ##[Coupled 1D Model.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/ccar-modeling/pa-th/raw/tip/prelim-model/Coupled 1D Model.ipynb)  
    
* ##[Th 2D Profile.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/ccar-modeling/pa-th/raw/tip/prelim-model/Th 2D Profile.ipynb)  
    
    Solves the [Th] on a 2D grid using an upwind advection scheme, and contains plots of [Th] profile for a zero velocity field, a single cell velocity field, and a two cell velocity field.  

* ##[Pa 2D Profile.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/ccar-modeling/pa-th/raw/tip/prelim-model/Pa 2D Profile.ipynb)  
    
    Solves the [Pa] on a 2D grid using an upwind advection scheme, and contains plots of [Pa] profile for a zero velocity field, a single cell velocity field, and a two cell velocity field.
