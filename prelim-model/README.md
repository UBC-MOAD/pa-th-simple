The IPython Notebooks in this directory are related to the
development of the preliminary Pa-Th off-line model for working with
results from the CCAR models of the Arctic and associated basins.

The links below are to static renderings of the notebooks via
[nbviewer.ipython.org](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/).
Descriptions below the links are from the first cell of the notebooks
(if that cell contains Markdown or raw text).

* ##[1DThModel.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/ccar-modeling/pa-th/raw/tip/prelim-model/1DThModel.ipynb)  
    
* ##[2DPaProfile.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/ccar-modeling/pa-th/raw/tip/prelim-model/2DPaProfile.ipynb)  
    
    Solves the [Pa] on a 2D 1e6m x 5e3m grid using an upwind advection scheme, and contains plots of [Pa] profile for a zero velocity field, a single cell velocity field, and a two cell velocity field.  

* ##[2DThProfile.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/ccar-modeling/pa-th/raw/tip/prelim-model/2DThProfile.ipynb)  
    
    Solves the [Th] on a 2D grid using an upwind advection scheme, and contains plots of [Th] profile for a zero velocity field, a single cell velocity field, and a two cell velocity field.  

* ##[2DThParatio.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/ccar-modeling/pa-th/raw/tip/prelim-model/2DThParatio.ipynb)  
    
    Solves the [Th]/[Pa] on a 2D grid using an upwind advection scheme, and contains plots of [Th]/[Pa] profile for a zero velocity field, a single cell velocity field, and a two cell velocity field.
